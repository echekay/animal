    <h3>Sea Urchin</h3>
  </header>

  <p>The sea urchin is an animal that has come into style within the last few years it seems. Personally myself, I have never had the pleasure of cracking one open and tasting the golden nectar that's encapsulated within it's spiny, defensive shell.</p>

  <p>There is no other information I can gather as I'm typing this on a plane, 20, 000 feet up in the air on my way to Las Vegas. A trip with the fellas as we emabark on one of my closest friends' rite of passage that is his bachelor's party.</p>
