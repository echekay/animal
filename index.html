    <p>The sea urchin is an animal that has come into style within the last few years it seems. Personally myself, I have never had the pleasure of cracking one open and tasting the golden nectar that's encapsulated within it's spiny, defensive shell.</p>

    <p>From Wikipedia: The gonads of both male and female sea urchins, usually called sea urchin roe or corals, are culinary delicacies in many parts of the world. In Mediterranean cuisines, <em>Paracentrotus lividus</em> is often eaten raw, or with lemon, and known as <em>ricci</em> on Italian menus where it is sometimes used in pasta sauces. It can also flavour omelettes, scrambled eggs, fish soup, mayonnaise, bechamel sauce for tartlets, the <em>boullie</em> for a souffle, or Hollandaise sauce to make a fish sauce. In Chilean cuisine, it is served raw with lemon, onions, and olive oil. Thought the edible <em>Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis</em> is found in the North Atlantic, it is not widely eaten. However, sea urchins (called <em>uutuk</em> in Alutiiq) are commonly eaten by the Alaska Native population around Kodiak Island. It is commonly exported, mostly to Japan. In the West Indies, slate pencil urchins are eaten. On the Pacific Coast of North America, <em>Strongylocentrotus franciscanus</em> was praised by Euell Gibbons; <em>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</em> is also eaten. In New Zealand, <em>Evechinus chloroticus</em>, known as <em>kina</em> in Maori, is a delicacy, traditionally eaten raw. Though New Zealand fisherman would like to export them to Japan, their quality is too varied. In Japan, sea urchin is known as <em>uni</em>, and its roe can retail for as much as (INSERT 40000 YEN IN HERE WITH SYMBOL AND TAKE OUT THE PARENTHESIS) (INSERT 360 DOLLARS HERE WITH SYMBOL) per kg; it is served raw as <em>sashimi</em> or in sushi, with soy sauce and <em>wasabi</em>. Japan imports large quantities from the United Sates, South Korea, and other producers. Japanese demand for sea urchin corals has raised concerns about overfishing. Native Americans in California are also known to eat sea urchins. The coast of Southern California is known as a source of high quality uni, with divers picking sea urchin from kelp beds in depths as low as 24 m/80 ft. As of 2013, the state was limiting the practice to 300 sea urchin diver licenses.</p>
